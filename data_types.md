# Data Types

## Literal

A literal is data whose values are determined by the literal itself . Examples include numbers like `42`, `3.14`, strings like `"Hello"`, and boolean values like `True` and `False`

### Integers

#### octal

If an integer number is preceded by an `0O` or `0o` prefix (zero-o), it will be treated as an octal value. This means that the number must contain digits taken from the [0..7] range only. For example, ```0o72``` or ```0O72``` represents ```58``` in python.
#### hexadecimal
If octal number preceded by ```0o``` or ```0O```, hexadecimal number preceded by ```0x``` or ```0X```. For example, in hexadecimal number, ```0x72``` represents ```114```. 
### Floats
Floats are numbers that have a decimal point. They can represent fractional values and are used when more precision is needed than what integers provide.
