# Computer Architecture

We need to at least know how computer interprets programs. The modern computer architecture is bason Neumann architecture which divides the computer into two main parts; the CPU (Central Processing Unit) and the memory. This architecture is used in all modern computer including cell phones.

## Structure of Computer Memory

To better understand how computer memory work, imagine a local post office that has a room filled with PO Boxes. Those boxes are similar to computer memory in that each are numbered sequences of fixed-size storage locations. For example if we have 256 megabytes of computer memory, it means that our computer contains roughly 256 million fix-size storage locations. Or refering to local post analogy, 256 million PO Boxes. Each location has a number, and each location has the same, fixed-length size. There is one thing to remember that we can store akk different kinds of things in a PO Box, but we cannot do the same in computer memory, we can only store a single number in a computer memory storage location. 

The computer memory is organized that way because it is simple to implement. Everything that is "stored" is stored in memory. Imagine the following:

* The location of our cursor on the screen
* The size of each window on the screen
* The shape of each letter of each font being used
* The layout of all of the controls on each window
* The graphics for all of the toolbar icons
* The text for each error message and dialog box
* The list goes on ...
